# What is it?
This github repo is documentation for a modem in a roblox game called "Zombie defense" (https://www.roblox.com/games/4711958375/Zombie-Defence)

| Operator      | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| not      | returns the reverse (example a is false then not a is true) |
| and      | if one, two or all of operands are false, then condition becomes false. If both of the operands are true then condition becomes true   |
| or | if one operand is true, then the condition becomes true      | 
| xor | No documentation      | 
| + | adds two numbers      | 
| < | if left operand is less than right operand, then the condition is true      | 
| > | if right operand is less than left operand, then the condition is true      | 
| <= | if left operand is equal or less than right operand, then the condition is true      | 
| >= | if right operand is equal or less than left operand, then the condition is true      | 
| == | if both operands are equal, then the condition is true     | 


>digialWrite
```lua
digitalWrite(x (number), y (boolean))
```
digialWrite turns on the turret on frequency x if y is true and turns off the turret on frequency x if y is false

>digitalRead
```lua
digitalRead(x (number))
```
returns is modem on frequency x on.

>delay
```lua
delay(x (number))
```
waits in miliseconds

#some things might be missing and will probably be added later
